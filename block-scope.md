# ECMA Script 6 - Block Scoping with 'let' keywork
* The block scope restricts a variableâ€™s access to the block in which it is declared.
* This can be done using 'let' keyword.
* when we declare a variable with 'var' keyword  it is global-scoped,but when you declare a variable using 'let' keyword it is block-scoped.
* 'let' cannot be hoisted.
