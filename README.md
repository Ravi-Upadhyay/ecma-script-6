# ECMA Script 6 - Let's Learn

ECMAScript (ES) is a scripting language specification standardized by [ECMA International](http://www.ecma-international.org/). 

> [ECMA International](http://www.ecma-international.org/) is an industry association founded in 1961, dedicated to the standardization of information and communication systems.

## Why I need to learn ES6

* ECMAScript is a standard. While JavaScript is the most popular implementation of that standard. 
* JavaScript implements ECMAScript and builds on top of it.
* ES6/ES2015 adds significant new syntax for writing complex applications.
* After this ES7/ES2016 and ES8/ES2017 also got released.
* ES.Next is dynamic term which refers to next version to come out.

## An Irony in JS/ES Development

It can be seen as major challange in JS development. JS code is compiled at run time on user's machine. If you are using some latest standards in your code, you have to make sure it do not breaks in case the browsers are not updated. Every fearure that released by ECMA is implemented by different browsers independently. `Transpilers` is saviour in these situations. It first translate your code into widely acccepted standard (i.e. ES5) then compile. [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) is very famous such transpiler. You even heared about terms `Polyfills/Shims` These are equivalent code which can ensure backwards compatibility. Here  is list of some popular `Polyfills/Shims` being used.
